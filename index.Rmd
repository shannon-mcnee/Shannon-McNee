# Research 

My research focuses on social comparison behaviour on social media and how this relates to the mental wellbeing and sleep health of young people. Specifically, I am interested in constructing "profiles" of social media use which highlight both the risk and protective factors of social media use, which can be used to inform the development of integrated social media use and sleep interventions.
